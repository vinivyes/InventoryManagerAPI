# InventoryManagerAPI
Open Source project for a Inventory Manager API developed in ASP.NET.

This is intended as an project that can be used as a template to anyone who is interested in building an API for Inventory Management in ASP.NET or believes that this can be used as a base for any other project.

This project will leverage Entity Framework 7 - and be paired with PostgreSQL database, which you could easily change.
