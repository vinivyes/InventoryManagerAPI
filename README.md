# InventoryManagerAPI
Open Source project for a Inventory Manager API developed in ASP.NET.

This is intended as an project that can be used as a template to anyone who is interested in building an API for Inventory Management in ASP.NET or believes that this can be used as a base for any other project.

This project will leverage Entity Framework 7 - and be paired with PostgreSQL database, which you could easily change.

## Roadmap
I will be dedicating time to this project when possible and the main features I am aiming for are:
1. **User Management:**
- ~~CRUD for User~~ **Done**
- ~~CRUD for Roles~~ **Done**
- ~~Endpoint for Login with Email and Password~~ **Done**
- ~~RBAC for all endpoints~~ **Done**
2. **Product Management:**
- CRUD for Category
- CRUD for Subcategories
- CRUD for Products
3. **Inventory Management:**
- CRUD for Inventory Entries
- Returns
- Sales/Orders
4. **ChatGPT (or maybe another LLM):**
- System that leverages LLMs to interpret Natural Language requests and initiate API Actions or answer questions about the state of the system.
5. **Frontend**
- Create a webpage to consume this API
- The webpage will be another Open Source Project and will be linked here
